# Edge Function Streaming Fixes

## Issues Resolved

### 1. TypeError: expected typed ArrayBufferView
**Problem**: The Edge Functions were trying to enqueue plain strings to the transform stream controller, but Deno's streaming implementation requires typed arrays (Uint8Array).

**Solution**: Added `TextEncoder` to convert strings to Uint8Array before enqueueing:
```typescript
const encoder = new TextEncoder();
// Before: controller.enqueue(`data: ${JSON.stringify({ content })}\n\n`);
// After:  controller.enqueue(encoder.encode(`data: ${JSON.stringify({ content })}\n\n`));
```

### 2. Missing Route for Anthropic Streaming
**Problem**: Client was calling `/api/anthropic-stream` but no Edge Function was configured for this path.

**Solution**: Added the missing route in `netlify.toml`:
```toml
[[edge_functions]]
  path = "/api/anthropic-stream"
  function = "ai-stream"
```

### 3. OpenRouter Support Missing
**Problem**: OpenRouter models were not supported in the Edge Functions.

**Solution**: Added OpenRouter support to `ai-stream.ts`:
- Detect OpenRouter models by checking for `/` in model ID
- Added OpenRouter API endpoint and headers
- Use same streaming format as OpenAI (they're compatible)

## Files Modified

1. **netlify/edge-functions/ai-stream.ts**
   - Fixed TextEncoder implementation for proper ArrayBufferView handling
   - Added OpenRouter model support
   - Updated transform stream to handle all three providers

2. **netlify.toml**
   - Added `/api/anthropic-stream` route configuration

## Testing

Created test script: `test-edge-function-stream.js`
- Tests OpenAI, Claude, and OpenRouter streaming
- Validates proper stream handling
- Can be run locally or against deployed site

## Usage

To test the fixes:
```bash
# Local testing
npm run netlify:dev
node test-edge-function-stream.js

# Production testing
TEST_URL=https://your-site.netlify.app node test-edge-function-stream.js
```

## Notes

- Edge Functions use Deno runtime, not Node.js
- Always use `TextEncoder` for converting strings to Uint8Array in streams
- OpenRouter uses the same streaming format as OpenAI
- AIMLAPI was not found in the codebase (may need to be added separately)
